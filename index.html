    <section id="About">
        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p> I am a freshman Computer Engineering student at the University of Florida with aspirations to grow in the
            field of technology and become a skilled systems/hardware engineer. I have had a passion for computers and
            electronics from a young age, and have always enjoyed the process of building anything, from simple Legos to
            whole desktop computers. I hope to expand my knowledge and eventually work on more complex and impactful
            projects!</p>
